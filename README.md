# Ajax-Form-Flatfile-Database

There are 2 ajax forms that I created.

1) Ajax Form for Flatfile

2) Ajax Form for Database

For the FlatFile version you have to change Permission on the Folder & File to these setting in order to write the file on your 
host server:

chmod -R 777

chmod -R 755

For the database version you have to created a database called ‘emails’and upload the 'ajax,sql' file to your database to create 
the table so you can insert the email address into the database. 

I also attach an instructions.pdf about the overview of the ajax form and also on how to put the email address into a cvs file.

I also included the indesign files that I created/design for the instructions.pdf file.

These are the languages and software I used for the ajax forms :

Language: HTML, CSS, JQuery/Ajax & PHP/PDO

Software: Dreamweaver, Photoshop and Indesign
